Redux Oct 17

* Actions (switch statements)

lifecycle
* Action creator : functions that get passed data and they create json object with data
* Action : nicely formatted data / action that comes from the action creator
* Dispatch : 
* Reducer : updates state /store and says there is a change and then updates accordingly

- Anytime there is a change React re-renders
- createStore
- <provider> : all components can act on it and receive data from it
- props : react magic
- regix : other magic
- data flows downward and is updated at the top
